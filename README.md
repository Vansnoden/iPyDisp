# iPyDisp

A Software to Simulate and Understand Insect Movements over time and space. iPyDisp is designed to simulate and comprehend insect movements over time and space, uses the principles of cellular automata. In the insect-related context, the cells can be in three potential states: unoccupied, colonized, or exposed. The software uses a 2D grid, with each cell having eight neighboring cells. The transition of a cell's state, which represents insect dispersal, depends on its current state and the states of its neighbors. A mathematical function determines the likelihood of insects colonizing a particular cell based on factors like food availability, suitable habitat, or favorable environmental conditions.
